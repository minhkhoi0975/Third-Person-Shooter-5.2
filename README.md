# Third-Person-Shooter
(WIP) This is the upgraded version of the original [Third Person Shooter](https://github.com/minhkhoi0975/Third-Person-Shooter) project. 
My current goals are:
  + Reorganize the file structure of the project.
  + Rewrite some gameplay logic in C++ instead of Blueprints.
  + Refactor some messy wires in the Blueprints.
  + Fix some features not working on Unreal 5.2. 

In the future, I will implement some new features to the game:
  + Create game modes.
  + Create more weapons.
